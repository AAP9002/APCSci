Notes on tools used HTB. These were made whilst I'm learning so there will likely be mistakes.

Over time, more I'll add more to this post.

## nmap

Shows services on ports when given an IP or Domain

```nmap -sV {ip}``` will show the OS name

```nmap -p- {ip}``` will scan for open ports 

```nmap -p- -T5 {ip}``` is a faster way but with drawbacks

## ping
```ping <ip address|domain>``` is used to test if a destination is reachable
